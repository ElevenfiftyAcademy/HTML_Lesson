Explain meta data of HTML // what does HTML stand for? (Hypertext Markup Language):

- DOCTYPE html simply states what type of document it is
- The head is the metadata, which is just more detailed data about the document (or data) as a whole
- charset="UTF-8" specifies the character encoding for the document
  - each character you're reading on the screen actually has a numeric value, and UTF-8 is just one of the encoding methods that were invented that let you write and read text in many languages
- name and content is setting the size and the view
- X-UA-Compatible is a meta data tag that allows you to choose what version of intenet explorer the page should be rendered as
- title is the document type that appears in our browser
- link lets us to connect to other files like a stylesheet that allow us to style our webpage
